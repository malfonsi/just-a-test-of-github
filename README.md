# just-a-test-of-github
Just a first test of GitHub and how it integrates with linux git

branches and tags are just to learn how to transfer branches/tags created with command line on my local repo

Now I checkout the 'testanewbranch' branch (creating it) and I just modify this file with this text. Then I will check if switching branches is indeed giving me the right version of this file. Finally I will try to push this branch to GitHub
